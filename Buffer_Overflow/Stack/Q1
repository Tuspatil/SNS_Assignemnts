Q1 : What is Stack guard?
Ans: The GCC compiler implements a security mechanism called “Stack Guard” to prevent buffer
overflows. In the presence of this protection, buffer overflow will not work. You can disable this
protection when you are compiling the program using the switch -fno-stack-protector.

Q2 : What is ASLR protection?
Ans : Ubuntu and several other Linux-based systems uses address space ran- domization to randomize the
starting address of heap and stack. This makes guessing the exact addresses difficult; guessing
addresses is one of the critical steps of buffer-overflow attacks.
